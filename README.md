Notable improvements/changes:

- Tabbed browsing: Double-click existing tab to get a new empty tab.
- More integrations to double-click menu. See about (i) for more information.
- QWebviewEngine capability integrations continue: code becomes a bit cleaner and more functional.
- UI is changed to become more clearer.

TODO in upcoming releases: 
	- Possibly integate label support as seen on previous releases.
	- Integrate url changing capabilities to other tabs than main. Currently urls do not change on other tabs when tab is changed away from the initial tab.
	- Enhance and integrate more QWebpage right-click functionalities.

	

Dependencies:

Something like below, should be enough.

python-pyqt5.qtwebengine python-pyqt5 ca-certificates




Remember to make the files executable with chmod +x some_file

Run the browser: python run.py
