# RunIT-QT_QWebengine
RunIT Browser (QWebEngine version)


RunIT Browser (QT-version) has received an upgrade. The browser now uses QWebEngine in providing the browser experience. 0.7 version adds tabs support for the browser.Since the transition is hardly ever a smooth thing to do, Open in a New Window and Web Inspector are currently dropped as features. In the future, I seek to bring these features back. The overall functionality is improved and the browser is acting a lot more stable than it previously did. Without further ado, here is a screenshot

Dependencies:

Something like below, should be enough.

python-pyqt5.qtwebengine python-pyqt5 ca-certificates

Remember to make the files executable with chmod +x some_file

Run the browser: python run.py
